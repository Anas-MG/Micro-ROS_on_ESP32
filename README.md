#### What is Micro Ros?
##### In shortcut Micro-Ros is Ros2 younger sibling, it puts ROS2 onto microcontrollers so we can publish and subscribe from microcontrollers to Ros2 .
##
##### Micro-ROS offers seven key features that make it ready for use in microcontroller-based robotic project:

###### ✔ Microcontroller-optimized client API supporting all major ROS concepts

###### ✔ Seamless integration with ROS 2

###### ✔ Extremely resource-constrained but flexible middleware

###### ✔ Multi-RTOS support with generic build system

###### ✔ Permissive license

###### ✔ Vibrant community and ecosystem

###### ✔ Long-term maintainability and interoperability

#
#### ESP32 and FreeRTOS:
##### ESP32 makes use of FreeRTOS(Real Time Operating System) one of the three RTOSes officially supported by the micro-ROS project, which is natively used by this family of boards, and supports the latest Foxy release of ROS 2. It works both with serial and Wi-Fi transports

#
### Project Goal:
##### The main goal in this project is to publish a Ros2 topic from Esp32 board to to choosen IP address through wifi, I've used freertos demo app called in32publisher, it'll automatecly will be in the work space after installation, so we'll not write any code.
##
#### Installation:
###### before setting up Micro-ros, you'll need to install Ros2 in the local machine to recieve ics from Micro-Ros, I've Used the offical documentation guide to installation via debian pkg https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html.

#### Micro-ROS build system: 
````
# Source ROS 2 installation
echo 'source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc

# Install colcon-core and commonly used extension packages in order to build Mirco-ros tools
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions

# Create a workspace and download the micro-ROS tools
mkdir microros_ws
cd microros_ws
git clone -b foxy https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_setup.git src/micro_ros_setup

# Update dependencies using rosdep
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-path src --ignore-src -y

# Install pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

# Build Micro-ros tools
colcon build

# Source Micro-ros installation
echo 'source install/local_setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
````

#### Build and flash ESP32 with freertos demo app called 'int32_publisher'
````
cd microros_ws
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_firmware_ws.sh freertos esp32
ros2 run micro_ros_setup configure_firmware.sh int32_publisher -t udp -i [your local machine IP] -p 8888
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh menuconfig

# Now go to the micro-ROS Transport Settings → WiFi Configuration menu, fill your local WiFi SSID and password. Save your changes, exit, and run:
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_firmware.sh

# Connect your ESP32 to the computer, and run:
ros2 run micro_ros_setup flash_firmware.sh
````

##### Setup Micro-ros Agent: 
````
cd microros_ws
# Download micro-ROS-Agent packages
ros2 run micro_ros_setup create_agent_ws.sh

# Build 
ros2 run micro_ros_setup build_agent.sh

# Run a micro-ROS agent << this step should be done before running the ESP32 board
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent udp4 --port 8888
````
